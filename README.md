# ABOUT US

### Our Mission

The Code Foundation is a non-profit organization whose primary objectives are education and culture. Our mission is to advance Codex for the good of society by developing and promoting state-of-the-art code technologies.


### What is Codex?

Created in 2011, Codex is a platform for sharing books among users. Users indicate the books they wish to share, creating the offer and the consequent demand, by other users. Codex provides the necessary means for users to have an enriching experience, enjoying the art of reading.
